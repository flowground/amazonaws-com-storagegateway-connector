    "description": "AWS Storage Gateway Service AWS Storage Gateway is the service that connects an\non-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and\nsecure integration between an organization's on-premises IT environment and\nAWS's storage infrastructure. The service enables you to securely upload data to\nthe AWS cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery.\n\nUse the following links to get started using the AWS Storage Gateway Service API\nReference:\n\n *   AWS Storage Gateway Required Request Headers\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPI.html#AWSStorageGatewayHTTPRequestsHeaders]\n   : Describes the required headers that you must send with every POST request\n   to AWS Storage Gateway.\n   \n   \n *   Signing Requests\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPI.html#AWSStorageGatewaySigningRequests]\n   : AWS Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request you send;\n   this topic describes how sign such a request.\n   \n   \n *   Error Responses\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPI.html#APIErrorResponses]\n   : Provides reference information about AWS Storage Gateway errors.\n   \n   \n *   Operations in AWS Storage Gateway\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html]\n   : Contains detailed descriptions of all AWS Storage Gateway operations, their\n   request parameters, response elements, possible errors, and examples of\n   requests and responses.\n   \n   \n *   AWS Storage Gateway Regions and Endpoints:\n   [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sg_region] Provides\n   a list of each AWS region and endpoints available for use with AWS Storage\n   Gateway. \n   \n   \n\nAWS Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these resource\nIDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in lowercase. You must\nchange your resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For example, in\nStorage Gateway the ID for a volume might be vol-AA22BB012345DAF670. When you\nuse this ID with the EC2 API, you must change it to vol-aa22bb012345daf670.\nOtherwise, the EC2 API might not behave as expected.\n\nIDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway\nvolumes are changing to a longer format. Starting in December 2016, all new\nvolumes and snapshots will be created with a 17-character string. Starting in\nApril 2016, you will be able to use these longer IDs so you can test your\nsystems with the new format. For more information, see Longer EC2 and EBS\nResource IDs [https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#longer-ids]. \n\n For example, a volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the longer volume ID\nformat looks like the following:\n\n \narn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG\n.\n\nA snapshot ID with the longer ID format looks like the following: \nsnap-78e226633445566ee.\n\nFor more information, see Announcement: Heads-up â€“ Longer AWS Storage Gateway\nvolume and snapshot IDs coming in 2016\n[https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=3557].",
